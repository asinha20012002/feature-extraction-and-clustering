# A 12-Dimension Feature vector extraction approach for DNA sequences of plants and then using modified K-menas clustering approach for clustering.
# Modified K-Means clustering algorithm by developing a distance-angle algorithm to get optimal initial cluster centroids unlike traditional K-Means to converge faster in terms of iterations. A cpombined score is evaluated for each feature vector by finding it's euclidean distance and cosine simillarity with a chosen reference vector.
# Fasta Dataset is taken from soybase.org
